# CAEX MDE Workbench

This project provides a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) Workbench for CAEX ([IEC](http://www.iec.ch/) 62424:2016). 

CAEX is one of the most promising standards for the data exchange between engineering tools in the production system automation domain. This is also reflected by the current emergence of [AutomationML](https://www.automationml.org/o.red.c/home.html), which uses CAEX as its core representation data format. 

The Model-Driven Engineering Workbench for CAEX is based on the [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) and provides the following components:
1. Metamodels for CAEX version 2.15 and version 3.0.
2. A tree-based editor for creating, modifying and inspecting CAEX 2.15 and CAEX 3.0 models.
3. A graphical editor for visualizing CAEX 3.0 Instance Hierarchies.
4. A textual editor for creating, modifying and inspecting CAEX 2.15 Instance Hierarchies.
5. Modeling rules for the correct usage of CAEX with AutomationML.
6. Migration operations for converting CAEX 2.15 models into CAEX 3.0 models.

### Install the CAEX MDE Workbench

To install the CAEX MDE Workbench, import all projects contained in the [*plugins folder*](plugins) of this repository into your Eclipse workspace. Then, start a new Eclipse instance. 

In the new Eclipse instance, all features of the CAEX MDE Workbench are available.

## HOW TO 

### CAEX Metamodels

The CAEX MDE Workbench provides metamodels for CAEX 2.15 and CAEX 3.0 defined with [Ecore](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/). You can find the metamodels in the plugin projects [*caex.caex215*](plugins/caex215/caex.caex215) and [*caex.caex30*](plugins/caex30/caex.caex30). In these projects, you can also find Java APIs that allow tool developers to programmatically access CAEX 2.15 and CAEX 3.0 models.

Further documentation on the metamodels can be found in the [*documentation folder*](documentation) of this repository.

### Tree-Based CAEX Editors

To create a CAEX 2.15 or CAEX 3.0 model, first create an empty project (*File* > *New* > *Project...* > *General*/*Project*). Within this project, you can create a new CAEX model by selecting *File* > *New* > *Other...* > *CAEX*/*CAEX 2.15 Model* or *CAEX*/*CAEX 3.0 Model*. The newly created CAEX model will be immediately opened in the tree-based editor. It will contain already the root element *CAEX File*. Use the context menu *New Child* to add further elements to your CAEX model as well as the *Properties* view to set attributes for the elements.

You can find example CAEX models in the [*examples folder*](examples) of this repository.

### Graphical CAEX 3.0 Editor

To visualize a CEAX 3.0 Instance Hierarchy graphically, you first need to create a *Representations File*. For this, select *File* > *New* > *Other...* > *Sirius*/*Representations File*. Select "Initialization from a semantic resource" as initialization kind and your CAEX model file (*.caex) in the next wizard pages. Select the Viewpoint "CAEX 3.0" in the following Viewpoints Selection dialog. 
A new *.aird file will be created as a result. Unfold the *.aird file in the Project Explorer to the lowest level, which is labeled "CAEX 3.0 Instance Hierarchy Diagram". Open the diagram by double-clicking on this item. This will open the graphical representation of your CAEX model where you can inspect your CAEX Instance Hierarchy and update its graphical representation.

### Textual CAEX 2.15 Editor

The CAEX MDE Workbench also provides a textual editor for CAEX 2.15 that allows to create, modify and inspect CAEX 2.15 Instance Hierarchies in a textual representation. To create a textual CAEX 2.15 model, create a new File using the menu *File* > *New* > *File* and specify an appropriate file name with the file extension ".caext". Hit the *Finish* button to create the file. If the dialog *Configure Xtext* shows up, confirm it by hitting *Yes*.

Your newly created textual CAEX 2.15 model will be automatically opened in the textual editor. Start defining your CAEX File by typing "CAEXFile". Explore elements that can be created by using the auto-completion feature of the editor that you can activate by pressing *Ctrl+Space*.
An example of a textual CAEX 2.15 model can be found in the [*caex.caex215.examples* project](examples/caex215/caex.caex215.examples/PPU/PPU.caext).

### AutomationML Modeling Rules

The AutomationML modeling rules for CAEX 3.0 are implemented by the [EVL](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/evl/) script located in the project [*caex.caex30.aml.validation*](plugins/aml/caex.caex30.aml.validation). To validate these modeling rules on your CAEX 3.0 model, copy and adapt the provided sample launch configuration *CAEX30_AMLRules*(plugins/aml/caex.caex30.aml.validation/CAEX30_AMLRules.launch). For this, right-click on *CAEX30_AMLRules.launch* and select *Run As* > *Run configurations...*. Select *CAEX30_AMLRules* and click on the second item in the menu bar, which will copy the launch configuration. Give an appropriate name and switch to the *Models* tab. Select the entry *caex30* and hit the *Edit...* button. Select your model using the *Browse Workspace...* button located next to the *Model file* field. Confirm your changes by hitting *OK*. Now hit the *Run* button to validate the modeling rules. In the *Validation* view, you will see the evaluation result, in particular, all violations of AML modeling rules.

### CAEX 2.15 to 3.0 Migration

The CAEX 2.15 to 3.0 Migrator comprises two components: One *Checker Component* that checks whether a CAEX 2.15 model can be migrated to CAEX 3.0 and one *Transformation Component* that migrates CAEX 2.15 models to CAEX 3.0. Both components are implemented in the project [*caex.caex215.migration.caex30*](plugins/caex215/caex.caex215.migration.caex30).

The Checker Component is implemented by the [EVL](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/evl/) script [*caexMigrationChecker*](plugins/caex215/caex.caex215.migration.caex30/checkers/caexMigrationChecker.evl). It identifies elements in CAEX 2.15 models that need to be adapted in order to migrate it to CAEX 3.0. For instance, it checks whether all *InternalLink* elements have both partner sides set. If an *InternalLink* element does not have both partner sides set, this first has to be fixed manually in order to achieve a fully automated migration to CAEX 3.0. This is because CAEX 3.0 requires that both partner sides are set.

To run the Checker on your CAEX 2.15 model, copy and adapt the provided sample launch configuration [*caexMigration-PPU_TestCase*](plugins/caex215/caex.caex215.migration.caex30/launcher/caexMigrationChecker-PPU_TestCase.launch) following the same steps as explained for validating [AutomationML Modeling Rules](#automationml-modeling-rules).

The Transformation Component is implemented by the [ATL](https://eclipse.org/atl/) transformation [*caexMigration*](plugins/caex215/caex.caex215.migration.caex30/transformation/caexMigration.atl). To execute this migration transformation on your CAEX 2.15 model, copy and adapt the provided sample launch configuration [*caexMigration-PPU_TestCase*](plugins/caex215/caex.caex215.migration.caex30/launcher/caexMigration-PPU_TestCase.launch). For this, right-click on *caexMigration-PPU_TestCase.launch* and select *Run As* > *Run configurations...*. Select *caexMigration-PPU_TestCase* and click on the second item in the menu bar, which will copy the launch configuration. Give an appropriate name and select your CAEX 2.15 model as *Input Model*. Select an appropriate location for your migrated CAEX 3.0 model as *Output Model*. Now hit the *Run* button to run the migration transformation. The migrated CAEX 3.0 model will be created at the specified *Output Model* location.

### Variability Functionality to the Sirius Editor
We added the variability functionality to the AutomationML environment using the [*VERSO* tool](https://github.com/antoniogarmendia/ecore-product-line). We demostrate how it works in the project example: [*caex.caex30.feature.variability.ppu*](examples/caex30/caex.caex30.feature.variability.ppu). This project is based on the Pick and Place Unit (PPU) and generate the variants of six documented scenarios (Sc0,  Sc1,  Sc2, Sc3, Sc4a and Sc4b).
